*** The Game

Same sequence as before with I, IN, INN, E, WIN mcguffin etc:

I word -> open 2 letter words. [ should there be something required to unlock this?]
(maybe) 50I->reveal N [N appears after 50 glyphs. typing N results in red feedback and maybe log message ("letter N not available")]
10I letter->N
IN->unlock 3 letter words
INN->automation ( purchases I automation (mediated by a repeat function key: ctrl))
10N letter->unlock E?
WIN : win the game [display early on]
(maybe)[sth]->W  [display a bit later]
(maybe)[sth]->unlock N for good

I type available letters:
I, maybe N (when unlocked)

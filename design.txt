*** The Game

Same sequence as before with I, IN, INN, E, WIN mcguffin etc:

I word -> open 2 letter words. [ should there be something required to unlock this?]
(maybe) 50I->reveal N [N appears after 50 glyphs. typing N results in red feedback and maybe log message ("letter N not available")]
10I letter->N
IN->unlock 3 letter words
INN->key automation ( purchases I automation (mediated by a repeat function key: ctrl))
10N letter->unlock E? (or better price 1000N?)
WIN : win the game [display early on]
(maybe)[sth]->W  [display a bit later]
(maybe)[sth]->unlock N for good

Type available letters:
I, maybe N (when unlocked)



Qs:

*Base mechanics/word typing:
buy from anywhere? or only top of "input stack"? -> Can buy from anywhere, but starting from right to left.
Typing order: add to the right.
Claiming a letter is simpler : type letter (temp. activated on keyboard), get letter
"Enter" key to claim (rightmost word). Ambiguous, How do I decide what word to claim? -> Rightmost
Enter also works as word repeat key. (slow at first)
"Type word, get effect" for now. No in-stream tokens
If I purchase a letter N, does it a) replace the 10I in-place? Or b) is it added to the end of the stream? a) most certainly
I(15)ENI(5) -> press E :a)  I(5)EENI(5) or  b) I(5)ENI(5)E !

I can't see the words like this. best IENI with the 5's underneath? or smaller as subscript?


-Other
Do some DictItems disappear after use? -> no need to answer that now
